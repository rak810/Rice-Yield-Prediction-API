# Rice-Yield-Prediction-API
An API for rice yield prediction ML project for CSE3200

The model is based on Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) network. It uses previous weather data and land information of various district of Bangladesh to predict rice of a given land size for a district future in time. The model was used to build the API using Python [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) dependency manager. This API is hosted on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/). The frontend code is [here](https://github.com/rak810/Rice-Yield-Prediction-View). And The website is [here](https://rice-yield-prediction-view.vercel.app/).
